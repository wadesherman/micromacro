# Firmware

## Ardiuno Sketch
This .ino file can easily be installed to the Pro Micro using the Arduino IDE. 

Install [SparkFun's board files]( https://github.com/sparkfun/Arduino_Boards) so the IDE will recognize the Pro Micro.

**Be extra careful to select the correct version of the Pro Micro before flashing the firmware to the board**

## QMK
[QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) supports the Pro Micro, so it is theoretically possible to run QMK on this with a custom layout.
